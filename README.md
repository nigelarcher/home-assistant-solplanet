Fork of https://github.com/calvinbui/home-assistant-solplanet/fork to try and get HTTPS connections working correctly for new Voltx dongle

# Solplanet / VoltX Inverter Integration

This integration polls a local [Solplanet inverter dongle](https://solplanet.net/au/products/ai-dongle) (including [VoltX-branded devices](https://voltxenergy.com.au/)) and exposes Inverter, Battery and Smart Meter information for Home Assistant.

This repository is a fork of the upstream integration by `zbigniewmotyka`, with a primary focus on **V2 devices/firmware**.

> [!Important]
> This fork does not aim to add new features or fixes for **V1**.

## Features

- Supports single-phase and three-phase inverters
- Sensors for inverter, battery and smart meter/s
- Battery mode control
- Battery schedule management (set/clear schedule slots)
- V2 meter “power limit control” (Limit power / Limit current / Zero power)
- Modbus RTU-over-HTTP (advanced service for writing holding registers)
- Designed to reduce device “flapping” (serialized polling + graceful degradation on timeouts)
